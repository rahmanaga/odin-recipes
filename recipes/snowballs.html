    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Snowballs, a.k.a. Russian tea cakes or Mexican wedding cookies, are
      melt-in-your-mouth cookies made with staple ingredients: butter, powdered
      sugar, vanilla extract, flour, finely chopped nuts, and salt. The round
      cookies are rolled in powdered sugar, so they sort of resemble snowballs.
      The festive treat is often served during the holiday season.
